# DarkRoomFanPatch
### You awake to find yourself in a dark, but slightly buggy, room!!
This patch is intended to provide fixes for The Dark Room game. This script will not work if you do not own the game. If you haven't already, please go support John by buying the game here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/918530/The_Dark_Room/

If a game update comes out, the script will not work until we update it. 

We recommend that you run the python version, however, if you don't have python then there is a compiled exe you can use instead.

If any issues occur then please follow these steps:

* Right-click "The Dark Room" in your Steam library
* Click "Properties"
* Click "Local Files"
* Finally click on "Verify Integrity of Game Files"
* Wait for steam to finish and re-install the problematic files (You will need to re-apply the patch)

### Fixes
* Kafka achievement is now obtainable - You'll have to figure out how to get this yourself you little cockroach!
